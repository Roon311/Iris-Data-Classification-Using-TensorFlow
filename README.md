# Iris Data Classification Using TensorFlow

## Introduction

The [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris/) stands as a renowned benchmark for classification tasks in machine learning. Comprising 150 samples of iris plants, each entry encompasses four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) along with a target label indicating the species of the iris plant (setosa, versicolor, or virginica).

Addressing the assignment centered around the Iris dataset involves a systematic approach. The process commences with data preprocessing, encompassing tasks such as feature scaling and the partitioning of data into training and validation sets. Subsequently, the development and training of a Deep Learning model unfold, requiring decisions on architecture, optimization algorithms, learning rates, and epoch counts. The final step entails a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance, employing metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to gauge its proficiency in accurately classifying the diverse iris plants.
